      In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br />
      A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br />
      Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br />
      Through caverns measureless to man<br />
      Down to a sunless sea.

      So twice five miles of fertile ground<br />
      With walls and towers were girdled round;<br />
      And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br />
      Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br />
      And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br />
      Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

      But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br />
      Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br />
      A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br />
      As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br />
      By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br />
      And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br />
      As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing.
